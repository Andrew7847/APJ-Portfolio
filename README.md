# CS-210 Project 3

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
 This project was intended to take input from a "grocery store" as a text file and offer a user multiple options including showing the sales of each item in a day, 
 the sales of a particular item that the user can soecify, and the ability to create a histogram of sales
  
# What did you do particularly well?
 I kept the code clean and logical. The user menu is simple and easy to use. Comments included on just about everything.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
 One thing I wish I would have done is instead of manually creating the frequency file, I should have used code to create the file in case it wasn't present on the user's
 system. I also could have spiced up the user menu and made it more interactive/pleasant to use.
 
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
 The most challenging part was creating the code that accessed the Python source code from the C++ code and having it correctly return the values that I needed. There were
 no additional resources I used outside of the usual StackOverflow and the C++/Python documentation.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
 The ability to combine multiple languages will be particuarly useful in the future as the Python collections library was extremely helpful to be able to use. Also, the
 fact that I now understand GitHub repos and how to use Visual Studio to push and pull will come in handy.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 The Python code in particular along with the user menu can easily be adapted and used for other projects. Several of my Python functions can be used in plenty of other
 instances where counting instances from an input file is required. Also, the C++ code to access the Python functions can easily be repurposed for other projects in the 
 future and modified for whatever I need. I also added plenty of comments to the code so it is easy to understand and reuse in the future.
